# Barcode and QR Code Scanner and Verification System
Created a robust Barcode and QR Code system to streamline inventory
management and enhance security by accurately identifying and verifying
products.
Leveraged Python and OpenCV libraries to develop the scanning module.
Implemented real-time image processing techniques to extract barcode and QR
code data from images captured by the device's camera.
Designed algorithms to validate scanned data against the backend database,
ensuring accurate identification and preventing discrepancies between scanned
codes and stored product information.
Implemented robust error handling mechanisms to manage scenarios such as
unreadable or mismatched codes, providing clear feedback to users and guiding
them through troubleshooting steps.
